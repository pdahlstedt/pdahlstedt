- 👋 Hi, I’m @pdahlstedt
- 👀 I have a long background as a software developer, mainly mission critical real-time system and control systems. Not professionally programming any longer, but missing that ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, react and type script.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects, c++, c or c# are my main languages.
